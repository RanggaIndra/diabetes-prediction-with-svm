# Diabetes Prediction with Support Vector Machine
This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on key health metrics. It is designed to assist in early diagnosis and intervention, providing insights through data-driven analysis.

## Features
- Comprehensive predictive modeling using health-related data

- Comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model

- User-friendly Jupyter Notebook workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

- Detailed insights through visualizations and performance metrics

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RanggaIndra/diabetes-prediction-with-svm.git
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction_Project.ipynb
```

## Data Overview
The dataset includes the following key features:

Glucose Level: Blood sugar levels

Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure

BMI: Body Mass Index

Age: Patient's age

Skin Thickness: Measurement of skin fold thickness

Insulin: Serum insulin levels

The target variable is binary, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

## Results
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to identify the most effective model.
